# HMC-Grad
Automate handwritten multiple-choice test grading using our implementation, HMC-Grad. Using a CNN trained in PyTorch on the EMNIST dataset and OpenCV for image processing, input a correction key and the images of the answer sheets to be graded to receive each one's correctness and score, along with item and score analysis, as CSV and XLSX files.
